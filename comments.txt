//Task 1

At first I went to the page to send Samy a friend request and then from the inspect element 
I went to the  use the chrome developer tools(inspect element) and from there found a get request.
The get request gave me the url.

After getting the url ,now it was needed to check if the id from where I am sending request is not Samy,
to prevent Samy from being attacked by the cod. For that I used view page source and found a elgg json object.

From there I got the userId of the person visiting Samy's profile.

I just used  a  if condition to check if the person was not Samy himself.


//Task 2

At first ,after logging in with a account(say Alice) ,I clicked edit profile and changed a accesibility to
"logged in users" from public and changed the value of the field. I got a "post" request in the network tab.
I saw the requestbody and thus realized the request url.FInally I incorporated my logic to make
everythings accesibility "logged in users"(which is accesibility=1).

FInally to make sure Samy doesnot get affected by the code,I used a if condition to check if the 
person vsiting samy's profile was not Samy himself.


//Task 3

For this Task, I logged in from Alice and posted some random things in the wire, thus I got a "Post" request.

I retrieved the url body and parameters and then edited the url.I edited the "body" in the url so that it conatins 
the link of the Samy's profile and the specified texts before it.

FInally to make sure Samy doesnot get affected by the code,I used a if condition to check if the 
person vsiting samy's profile was not Samy himself.


// Task 4
At first wormcode was constructed using the code given in the cheetsheet.
I just needed to pipeline task 1,2 and 3 .With a little change in the task 2 code part,

In that part , I changed the content to contain wormcode.

The rest was as same as previous ones.
